A responsive email (practice) project using the 'Foundation for Emails' framework. It utilizes gulp.js to compile sass, inline css, and transform Foundation's special html syntax - entitled 'inky' - into complex table/row elements. It also facilitates a modular approach to email coding. Sections can be saved as 'partials' and, using Handlebars.js, can be dynamically inserted into pages during the gulp.js build process. 

To view, simply clone and open the 'index.html' file in the 'dist' folder. Alternatively: clone it, run 'npm install', and 'npm start' (browser will be opened to view).
